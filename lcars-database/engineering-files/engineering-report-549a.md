# **ENGINEERING REPORT:** USS VALIANT NCC-75418
**Subject:** Structural Integrity Field Upgrade

**Date:** Stardate 56902.3

**Summary:**
The USS Valiant recently underwent a structural integrity field (SIF) upgrade to enhance the ship's resilience in high-stress situations and during combat engagements.

**Enhancements:**
1. **SIF Matrix Realignment:** The structural integrity field matrix was realigned for optimal coverage across the ship's hull.
2. **Duranium Alloy Reinforcements:** Key sections of the hull received duranium alloy reinforcements to withstand increased structural loads.
3. **Redundancy Protocols:** Implemented redundancy protocols for critical SIF components to ensure continuous integrity field coverage.

**Results:**
Initial tests indicate a 15% improvement in the ship's ability to withstand impacts and fluctuations in structural stress.

**Recommendations:**
1. Conduct additional stress tests under combat simulation scenarios to validate the effectiveness of the upgraded SIF.
2. Periodic diagnostics to monitor the stability and efficiency of the enhanced structural integrity field.

**Chief Engineer's Note:**
The USS Valiant is now equipped with a more robust structural integrity field, providing increased protection and safety for the crew during demanding missions.
